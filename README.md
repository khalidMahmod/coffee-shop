A day at a coffee shop!

- A customer visits a coffee shop that sells a bunch of items (e.g. beverages, sandwiches, etc.).
- Items have varying tax rates and some are free or offered at a discount when ordered with another item.
- The customer is made aware of the order total and once he pays for it, he can wait until notified of the order completion.
- You are required to describe a program with a set of interfaces that models the above problem at hand. You need to design the DB and backend architecture and implement it. Front-end is not mandatory but your endpoints should be reachable through Postman (please attach postman collection).
- Users should be able to see the list of available items, User should be able to order them and should get a notification after a fixed amount of time that their order is ready.
